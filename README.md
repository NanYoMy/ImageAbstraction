Image Abstraction
=================

Final project for CSC 205 2D Graphics and Image Processing. The algorithm used on 
images in this program is based on the process described in "Real-Time Video Abstraction".

This program creates a cartoon-like image abstraction from a given input image. This is achieved with 
several applications of a seperable approximation to a bilateral filter, lightness quantization, 
and overlayed difference-of-Gaussians edges.
